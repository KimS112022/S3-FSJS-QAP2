Using an http.createServer() method turns your computer into an HTTP server.

The HTTP createServer() method creates and HTTP Server Object.

The HTTP Server object can listen to ports on your computer and execute a function, or a requestListener, each time a request is made.  

Correct syntax is:

http.createServer(requestListener); 
//requestLIstener is optional.
